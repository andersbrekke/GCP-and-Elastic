# GCP-and-Elastic
## Monitoring IOT using Google Pub/Sub and ElasticSearch
### Summary: 
  This self-paced lab walks a user through creating a IOT simulator and using GCP and Elastic to explore this data in near real time. You will do this by creating an IOT simulator that sends data to Pub/Sub, then you will use Dataflow to move this data to Elastic.
This Lab will focus on analyzing and exploring Industrial IOT data, which can be used to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, improve customer experience and make better business decisions. You will learn how to set up an Elastic on GCP environment, create Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions, create a streaming Dataflow job, create an IIoT simulator that sends data, and explore the live data in Elastic. This lab aims to simulate how real companies can harness the power of GCP and Elastic to gain insights from their IOT data.
